# ONSDataCleansing
Data set preparation for ONS datasets.

## Weekly provisional registered deaths dataset (England and Wales)
Uses the dataset available by installing.package("NHSRdatasets") or through [GitHub](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRdatasets) and this repo is for the regular updates. 

The [vignette](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/NHSRdatasets/articles/ons_mortality.html) for the data set ons_mortality in NHSRdatasets applies to the methodology used here.

## Monthly registered deaths (England and Wales)
Work in progress to be submitted to NHSRdatasets once historical data has been cleaned and ordered. Regular updates will remain here.
